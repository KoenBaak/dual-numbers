# dual-numbers
This repo contains a package for automatic differentation with duals numbers and a small neural net framework to use it. Dual numbers provide a method for forward mode autodiff whereas one should definitely use reverse mode methods for applications like deep learning. This repo is just for fun, and exists just because it can. :)

A dual number is a number of the form $a + b\epsilon$ with the rule that $\espsilon^2 = 0$. So we have a ring of dual numbers $\mathbb{D}$ defined as $\mathbb{R}[X]/(X^2)$. Any real analytic function $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ can be extended to a dual function $\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{D}$ by setting $f(a+b\epsilon) = f(a) + bf\prime(a)\epsilon$. To see this one can easily check the property on polynominals and then use Taylor extensions. 

This property implies the following method of automatic differentation: 

- Evaluate the dual version of a function on $f(a+\epsilon)$.
- Inspect the dual component.

The package in this repo provides a numpy compatible `DualTensor` object. Just evaluate a numpy function on a dual tensor and once gets the derivative value for free! (Only some numpy functions are supported).
To showcase, there is also a small neural net framework that uses the dual tensors for autodiff. See the MNIST notebook for standard neural net example. 
As noted before, this only works nicely in theory, for any practical usage, the method is just too slow.
